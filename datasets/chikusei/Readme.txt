The airborne hyperspectral dataset was taken by Headwall Hyperspec-VNIR-C imaging sensor over agricultural and urban areas in Chikusei, Ibaraki, Japan, on July 29, 2014 between the times 9:56 to 10:53 UTC+9. The central point of the scene is located at coordinates: 36.294946N, 140.008380E. The hyperspectral dataset has 128 bands in the spectral range from 363 nm to 1018 nm. The scene consists of 2517x2335 pixels and the ground sampling distance was 2.5 m. Ground truth of 19 classes was collected via a field survey and visual inspection using high-resolution color images obtained by Canon EOS 5D Mark II together with the hyperspectral data. The hyperspectral data and ground truth were made available to the scientific community in the ENVI and MATLAB formats at http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sal/hyperdata. More details of the experiment are presented in the technical report given below.
